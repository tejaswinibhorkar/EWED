Local SQL Server Tables - 

1. dynamicWaterCoeff - This will hold the coefficients (water Usage per generation) per plantCode per year
2. emissions - Base emissions table
3. emissionsCoeff - This will hold the coefficients (emissions per generation) per registryId per year
4. facility - Base facility table, can be used by hibernate to load data, but, has primary key as pgmSysId, thus 
will give primary key constraint violation if all facilities are loaded.
5. facility860 - All facilities with pgm_sys_acrnm as EIA-860. Adam's new view data.
6. facility860Info, facility860Mapping - Check create script to find how this is created. Used to 
map data in which one registryId has multiple facilities with pgmSysIds.
7. facilityInfo, facilityMapping - Split of facility to accommodate above constraint for old data.
8. gasInfo - Used for emissions as a reference table to know details of greenhouse gas on basis of gasId.
9. generation - Base generation table
10. generationEIA - generation data of only facilities with pgm_sys_acrnm as EIA-860. Later merged with generation.
11. generationFile - Data pulled in from flat file of EIA to confirm integrity of EIA API data. Hibernate currently
mapped to this table if pulling generation data from any flat file
12. Water [year] - Water Usage data imported from flat file directly.
13. waterUsage - waterUsage data - check scripts for creation
14. [tableName]backup - backup kept before making changes.

Local SQL Server Views - 
1. emPerYear - Emissions summed up for all gasIds per registryId per year
2. facAllRowsTemp - Check testing script
3. facilityJoin - Merging data temporary view
4. genPerRegPerYear - generationData summed up for all pgmSysIds (if more than 1) per registryId perYear
5. genPerRegPerYearPerMonth - same as above just with monthly data instead of yearly.
6. generationData summed up for all months per pgmSysIds.
7. waterUsagePerYear - Sums up waterUsage for all months per plantCode per year
